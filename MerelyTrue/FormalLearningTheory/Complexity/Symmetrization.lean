# Symmetrization and Ghost Sample Infrastructure

Reusable symmetrization/ghost sample machinery for uniform convergence bounds.
This file provides the symmetrization argument (SSBD Chapter 4/6, Kakade-Tewari Lecture 19)
that converts a one-sided uniform convergence question into a double-sample question,
then bounds the double-sample event via exchangeability + growth function.

## Main results

- `hoeffding_one_sided` : one-sided Hoeffding for bounded [0,1] losses
- `symmetrization_step` : P[∃h: TrueErr-EmpErr ≥ ε] ≤ 2·P_{double}[∃h: EmpErr'-EmpErr ≥ ε/2]
- `double_sample_pattern_bound` : double-sample bound via exchangeability + growth function
- `symmetrization_uc_bound` : two-sided UC bound 4·GF(C,2m)·exp(-mε²/8)
- `growth_exp_le_delta` : arithmetic: sample complexity makes the UC bound ≤ δ

## Infrastructure

- `DoubleSampleMeasure` : D^m ⊗ D^m as the product of two independent pi measures
- `MergedSample` : Fin (2*m) → X with the Fin.append isomorphism
- `SplitMeasure` : uniform measure over (2m choose m) splits for exchangeability argument

## Design notes

All theorems use the STANDARD Approach A (exchangeability + permutation) for T3,
NOT the relaxed iid Rademacher approach. This is the structurally correct argument
that avoids introducing unnecessary independence assumptions.

/-- One-sided Hoeffding: for iid Bernoulli(p) draws, the empirical average
    undershoots the mean by ≥ t with probability ≤ exp(-2mt²).

    **Proof strategy (3 steps):**

    1. **MGF bound (Hoeffding's lemma):** For X ∈ [0,1] with E[X] = p,
       E[exp(s(X-p))] ≤ exp(s²/8).
       - Adapt from `cosh_le_exp_sq_half` infrastructure in Rademacher.lean.
       - Key: convexity of exp on [0,1] gives E[exp(sX)] ≤ p·exp(s) + (1-p)·exp(0),
         then the s²/8 bound follows from ln(1 + x) ≤ x and Taylor expansion.
       ```
       have mgf_bound : ∀ (s : ℝ),
         ∫ x, Real.exp (s * (indicator x - p)) ∂D ≤ Real.exp (s^2 / 8) := by ...
       ```

    2. **Product independence:** E[exp(s·∑(X_i-p))] = ∏ E[exp(s(X_i-p))] ≤ exp(ms²/8).
       - Uses `MeasureTheory.Measure.pi` independence structure.
       - Needs: `Measure.pi` integral factorization for product of functions.
       - MEASURABILITY: `fun xs => Real.exp (s * ∑ i, f (xs i))` is measurable
         (composition of measurable functions).
       ```
       have product_bound : ∀ (s : ℝ),
         ∫ xs, Real.exp (s * ∑ i, (indicator (xs i) - p)) ∂Measure.pi (fun _ => D)
         ≤ Real.exp (m * s^2 / 8) := by ...
       ```

    3. **Exponential Markov + optimize:** P[∑(X_i-p) ≤ -mt]
       = P[exp(-s·∑(X_i-p)) ≥ exp(smt)] ≤ exp(-smt + ms²/8).
       Optimize over s: set s = 4t to get ≤ exp(-2mt²).
       - Uses Markov's inequality in ENNReal form.
       - CAST ISSUE: Markov gives ENNReal bound, need to convert exp(-2mt²) between
         ENNReal.ofReal and the measure value.
       ```
       have markov_step : ∀ (s : ℝ) (hs : 0 < s),
         Measure.pi (fun _ => D) {xs | ∑ i, (indicator (xs i) - p) ≤ -(m : ℝ) * t}
         ≤ ENNReal.ofReal (Real.exp (-(s * m * t) + m * s^2 / 8)) := by ...
       have optimize : Real.exp (-(4*t * m * t) + m * (4*t)^2 / 8)
         = Real.exp (-2 * m * t^2) := by ring_nf
       ```

    **CAST ISSUES to watch:**
    - `m : ℕ` needs cast to `ℝ` in the exponent: `(m : ℝ)`
    - `EmpiricalError` returns `ℝ`, `TrueErrorReal` returns `ℝ`, good — no ENNReal gap
    - The measure value is `ENNReal`, the bound `exp(-2mt²)` is `ℝ≥0∞` via `ENNReal.ofReal`

        -- Alternative: bound directly using measure_ge_le_exp_mul_mgf and optimize.

        -- This matches the pattern of iIndepFun_pi with X_i := fun x => p - indicator x

        -- In our case X_base is constant: X_base i = fun x => p - indicator x for all i.

/-! ## T2: Symmetrization Step -/

/-- Symmetrization: the probability of a large gap TrueErr-EmpErr
    is at most twice the probability of a large gap EmpErr'-EmpErr
    on the double sample.

    **Proof strategy (6 steps):**

    1. **Witness selection:** For S in the bad event, ∃h* ∈ C with
       TrueErr(h*) - EmpErr_S(h*) ≥ ε.
       ```
       -- In the bad event set, extract h* by classical choice
       have h_witness : ∀ xs ∈ bad_event, ∃ h* ∈ C,
         TrueErrorReal X h* c D - EmpiricalError X Bool h* (sample xs) (zeroOneLoss Bool) ≥ ε
       ```

    2. **Ghost sample mean:** E_{S'}[EmpErr_{S'}(h*)] = TrueErr(h*) ≥ EmpErr_S(h*) + ε.
       - Uses: `MeasureTheory.integral_pi` to compute E[EmpErr] over product measure.
       - KEY LEMMA: For fixed h, E_{D^m}[EmpiricalError(h,S)] = TrueErrorReal(h,c,D).
         This is because EmpErr = (1/m)∑ indicator(x_i), and E[indicator(x_i)] = TrueErrorReal.
       ```
       have expected_emp_err : ∀ h* : Concept X Bool,
         ∫ xs, EmpiricalError X Bool h* (sample xs) (zeroOneLoss Bool)
           ∂(Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin m => D))
         = TrueErrorReal X h* c D := by ...
       ```

    3. **Hoeffding on ghost sample:** P_{S'}[EmpErr_{S'}(h*) < TrueErr(h*) - ε/2] ≤ exp(-mε²/2).
       - Apply `hoeffding_one_sided` with t = ε/2.
       - The `hm_large` hypothesis ensures exp(-mε²/2) < 1/2:
         2·ln2 ≤ mε² ⟹ mε²/2 ≥ ln2 ⟹ exp(-mε²/2) ≤ 1/2.
       ```
       have hoeffding_ghost : ∀ h* ∈ C,
         Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin m => D)
           {xs' | EmpiricalError X Bool h* (sample xs') (zeroOneLoss Bool)
             < TrueErrorReal X h* c D - ε/2}
         ≤ ENNReal.ofReal (Real.exp (-m * (ε/2)^2 * 2)) := by
           intro h* _; exact hoeffding_one_sided D h* c m hm (ε/2) (by linarith) (by ...) (by ...)
       ```

    4. **Complementary probability:** P_{S'}[EmpErr_{S'}(h*) - EmpErr_S(h*) ≥ ε/2] ≥ 1/2.
       - From step 2: TrueErr(h*) ≥ EmpErr_S(h*) + ε
       - From step 3: P[EmpErr_{S'} ≥ TrueErr - ε/2] ≥ 1/2
       - Chain: EmpErr_{S'} ≥ TrueErr - ε/2 ≥ EmpErr_S + ε - ε/2 = EmpErr_S + ε/2

    5. **Conditional to unconditional:** The witness h* from step 1 also witnesses the
       double-sample event ∃h∈C: EmpErr'-EmpErr ≥ ε/2. So:
       P_{S'}[double event | S bad] ≥ 1/2.
       ```
       have conditional_bound : ∀ xs ∈ bad_event,
         Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin m => D)
           {xs' | ∃ h ∈ C, EmpiricalError ... xs' - EmpiricalError ... xs ≥ ε/2}
         ≥ ENNReal.ofReal (1/2) := by ...
       ```

    6. **Fubini integration:** By Measure.prod_apply and Fubini:
       P_{S,S'}[double event] = ∫_S P_{S'}[double event | S] ≥ (1/2) · P_S[bad event]
       ⟹ P_S[bad event] ≤ 2 · P_{S,S'}[double event].
       ```
       -- Uses: MeasureTheory.Measure.prod_apply or lintegral_prod
       -- MEASURABILITY: the double-sample event is measurable as a finite union
       -- of sets of the form {(xs,xs') | EmpErr'(h) - EmpErr(h) ≥ ε/2} for h ∈ C.
       -- Since C may be infinite, measurability requires care: the sup over h
       -- must be shown to be measurable. For finite restriction patterns (≤ 2^m
       -- on Fin m → Bool), this is a finite union.
       ```

    **MEASURABILITY CONCERNS:**
    - `{xs | ∃ h ∈ C, ...}` is NOT obviously measurable for infinite C.
      Strategy: decompose via restriction patterns. On any fixed xs, the set of
      labelings {(h(xs 0), ..., h(xs(m-1))) | h ∈ C} has at most GF(C,m) ≤ 2^m
      elements. So the ∃h event is a finite union of measurable sets.
    - `EmpiricalError` is a finite sum of measurable functions, hence measurable.
    - The product σ-algebra on (Fin m → X) × (Fin m → X) is generated by
      cylinder sets, and our events are in this σ-algebra.

/-! ## T3: Double Sample Pattern Bound (Approach A — Standard Exchangeability) -/

/-- Per-hypothesis Hoeffding on the double sample: for a FIXED hypothesis h,
    the probability that EmpErr(h,S') - EmpErr(h,S) ≥ ε/2 under D^m ⊗ D^m
    is at most exp(-mε²/8).

    Proof: The gap = (1/m)∑ᵢ (Zᵢ' - Zᵢ) where Zᵢ = 1[h(xᵢ)≠c(xᵢ)], Zᵢ' = 1[h(x'ᵢ)≠c(x'ᵢ)]
    are iid Bernoulli(p) with p = TrueError(h,c,D). The differences Wᵢ = Zᵢ' - Zᵢ are
    independent, bounded in [-1,1], and centered (E[Wᵢ] = 0).
    By Hoeffding's inequality: P[(1/m)∑Wᵢ ≥ ε/2] ≤ exp(-mε²/8).

    This uses the sub-Gaussian machinery from T1, extended to the product space.

    **Proof sketch:**
    1. Pair D^m ⊗ D^m ≅ (D⊗D)^m via the natural isomorphism
       (Fin m → X) × (Fin m → X) ≃ᵐ Fin m → X × X
    2. Define g : X × X → ℝ, g(a,b) = 1[h(b)≠c(b)] - 1[h(a)≠c(a)]
       Then g ∈ [-1,1], E_{D⊗D}[g] = 0, so HasSubgaussianMGF g 1 (D⊗D)
    3. The gap = (1/m)∑ᵢ g(xᵢ, x'ᵢ) where pairs are iIndepFun under (D⊗D)^m
    4. By measure_sum_ge_le_of_iIndepFun: P[∑g ≥ mε/2] ≤ exp(-(mε/2)²/(2m)) = exp(-mε²/8)

/- The exchangeability + union bound + Hoeffding chain.
   ORPHANED — contains 2 sorrys (swap→signed avg + Tonelli).
   The critical path now uses `uc_bad_event_le_delta_proved` (below) which
   composes `symmetrization_uc_bound` + `growth_exp_le_delta` via the
   `finite_exchangeability_bound` + NullMeasurableSet architecture.
   This version remains because `double_sample_pattern_bound` and
   `symmetrization_uc_bound` (unprimed) call it, and those are called by
   the unprimed `vcdim_finite_imp_uc` in Generalization.lean.

   γ₁₈ (Session 7 discovery): The 2 sorrys here represent the original
   attempt to close the exchangeability chain via direct Tonelli interchange.
   Sorry A (swap→signed avg) needed connecting swap_fun to a Rademacher sum.
   Sorry B (Tonelli) was blocked by MeasurableSet requirements for uncountable C.
   Resolution: NullMeasurableSet + finite_exchangeability_bound (above). -/

/-- On the double sample, the probability that any hypothesis has
    EmpErr' - EmpErr ≥ ε/2 is bounded by GF(C,2m) · exp(-mε²/8).

    **Proof strategy (Approach A — standard exchangeability, 5 steps):**

    1. **EXCHANGEABILITY:** Under D^m ⊗ D^m, the 2m draws z₁,...,z_{2m} are iid from D.
       The joint distribution is invariant under permutations of {1,...,2m}.

       Key lemma: P_{D^m⊗D^m}[event(S,S')] = E_z[P_{split}[event | z]]
       where z = merged sample and the split is uniformly random among all
       C(2m,m) ways to partition z into two groups of m.

       ```
       -- Measure.pi permutation invariance
       have pi_perm_invariant : ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin (2*m))),
         (Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin (2*m) => D)).map (fun z i => z (σ i))
         = Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin (2*m) => D) := by ...
       -- Consequence: the event probability equals the split-averaged probability
       have exchangeability :
         DoubleSampleMeasure D m {p | ∃ h ∈ C, gap(p) ≥ ε/2}
         = ∫ z, SplitMeasure m {vs | ∃ h ∈ C, gap(split z vs) ≥ ε/2}
           ∂(Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin (2*m) => D)) := by ...
       ```

    2. **CONDITIONING:** For fixed merged sample z of 2m points:
       - C restricts to at most GF(C,2m) distinct labeling patterns on z (deterministic).
       - For each pattern p, define:
         diff(p, split) = EmpErr_{S'}(p) - EmpErr_S(p)
         = (1/m) ∑_{i∈S'} a_i - (1/m) ∑_{i∈S} a_i
         where a_i = 1[pattern(z_i) ≠ c(z_i)] ∈ {0,1}.

       ```
       -- Number of distinct patterns
       have num_patterns : ∀ (z : MergedSample X m),
         Set.ncard {p : Fin (2*m) → Bool | ∃ h ∈ C, ∀ i, p i = (h (z i) ≠ c (z i))}
         ≤ GrowthFunction X C (2*m) := by ...
       ```

    3. **PER-PATTERN HOEFFDING ON SPLITS:** For fixed z and fixed pattern p:
       Under uniformly random split (S,S') of z into two groups of m:
       diff(p, split) = (1/m) ∑_{i∈S'} a_i - (1/m) ∑_{i∈S} a_i

       This is a function of the random partition. By Hoeffding's inequality for
       sampling without replacement (Serfling 1974):
       P_split[diff ≥ ε/2] ≤ exp(-mε²/8)

       Alternative derivation: Hoeffding without replacement from Hoeffding with
       replacement (iid signs) via coupling. The without-replacement bound is
       actually TIGHTER (variance reduction), but the with-replacement bound suffices.

       ```
       -- Per-pattern concentration
       have per_pattern_bound : ∀ (z : MergedSample X m) (a : Fin (2*m) → ℝ)
         (ha : ∀ i, a i ∈ Set.Icc 0 1),
         SplitMeasure m {vs | (1/m) * ∑ i ∈ second_group vs, a i
           - (1/m) * ∑ i ∈ first_group vs, a i ≥ ε/2}
         ≤ ENNReal.ofReal (Real.exp (-(m : ℝ) * (ε/2)^2 / 2)) := by ...
       -- Note: m*(ε/2)^2/2 = mε²/8
       ```

    4. **UNION BOUND:** P_split[∃ pattern: diff ≥ ε/2 | z]
       ≤ (number of patterns) · max_pattern P_split[diff ≥ ε/2]
       ≤ GF(C,2m) · exp(-mε²/8)

       ```
       have union_bound : ∀ (z : MergedSample X m),
         SplitMeasure m {vs | ∃ h ∈ C, gap(split z vs, h) ≥ ε/2}
         ≤ ENNReal.ofReal (GrowthFunction X C (2*m) * Real.exp (-(m : ℝ) * ε^2 / 8))
         := by ...
       ```

    5. **INTEGRATE:** P_{D^m⊗D^m}[event]
       = E_z[P_split[event|z]]                      (by step 1)
       ≤ E_z[GF(C,2m) · exp(-mε²/8)]               (by step 4, pointwise)
       = GF(C,2m) · exp(-mε²/8)                     (bound is independent of z)

       ```
       -- The bound is a constant, so integrating gives the same constant
       -- (using IsProbabilityMeasure for the 2m-fold product)
       ```

    **Infrastructure needed:**
    - `Fin.sumFinEquiv : Fin m ⊕ Fin n ≃ Fin (m + n)` (available in Mathlib)
    - `mergeSamples` / `splitMergedSample` (defined above)
    - `SplitMeasure` and `ValidSplit` (defined above)
    - `Measure.pi` permutation invariance (to be proved or imported)
    - Hoeffding for sampling without replacement
    - `GrowthFunction` on 2m points + `sauer_shelah_exp_bound` from Rademacher.lean

    **MEASURABILITY CONCERNS:**
    - The merged sample z ↦ P_split[event|z] must be measurable as a function of z.
      Since the event is a finite union over patterns, and each pattern's indicator
      is a measurable function of z (finite evaluation), this follows.
    - `GrowthFunction X C (2*m)` is a natural number (deterministic), no measurability issue.

    2. **Upper tail:** P[∃h∈C: TrueErr-EmpErr ≥ ε] ≤ 2·GF(C,2m)·exp(-mε²/8)
       - Direct application of `symmetrization_step` + `double_sample_pattern_bound`.

    3. **Lower tail:** P[∃h∈C: EmpErr-TrueErr ≥ ε] ≤ 2·GF(C,2m)·exp(-mε²/8)
       - Apply the symmetric argument: swap roles of S and S' in the double sample.
       - Equivalently, apply `symmetrization_step` to the event EmpErr-TrueErr ≥ ε
         and bound the double-sample event {EmpErr_S - EmpErr_{S'} ≥ ε/2}.
       - The bound is symmetric because D^m ⊗ D^m is symmetric under swapping factors.
       ```
       have swap_symmetry :
         DoubleSampleMeasure D m {p | ∃ h ∈ C, EmpErr(S) - EmpErr(S') ≥ ε/2}
         = DoubleSampleMeasure D m {p | ∃ h ∈ C, EmpErr(S') - EmpErr(S) ≥ ε/2} :=
         Measure.prod_swap ...
       ```

    4. **Union bound:**
       P[|gap| ≥ ε] ≤ P[gap ≥ ε] + P[gap ≤ -ε]
                     ≤ 2·GF·exp(...) + 2·GF·exp(...)
                     = 4·GF(C,2m)·exp(-mε²/8)
       ```
