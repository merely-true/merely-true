# Dual VC Dimension (Assouad's Lemma)

The dual concept class and the bound `VCDim*(C) ≤ 2^(d+1) - 1`
where `d = VCDim(C)`. This is Assouad's (1983) coding lemma.

The **dual class** of a concept class `C ⊆ (X → Bool)` is the concept class
on the domain `↥C` where each point `x : X` induces a concept `c ↦ c x`.

## Main results

* `DualClass`  -  the dual concept class
* `dual_shatters_imp_original_shatters`  -  coding lemma: if the dual shatters
  `2^(d+1)` concepts, then the original class shatters `d+1` points
* `dual_vcdim_le_pow`  -  Assouad's bound: `VCDim*(C) ≤ 2^(VCDim(C)+1) - 1`

/-- Membership lemma for Assouad's dual VC construction: the evaluation function
`fun c => c x` belongs to the dual class `C^T` of `C`. Used in the bitstring coding
step of the dual bound `vcDim(C^T) ≤ 2^(vcDim(C) + 1) - 1`, the standard inequality
that lets compression arguments switch between primal and dual without losing
dimension control. -/

/-- Core coding lemma (Assouad 1983): if the dual class shatters a set `S`
    of concepts with `|S| ≥ 2^(d+1)`, then the original class shatters
    some set of `d+1` points.

    Proof: index `2^(d+1)` concepts by bitstrings `b : Fin (d+1) → Bool`.
    For each coordinate `j`, dual shattering provides a point `x_j` that
    "reads off" the `j`-th bit. Then `{x_0, ..., x_d}` is shattered by `C`. -/
