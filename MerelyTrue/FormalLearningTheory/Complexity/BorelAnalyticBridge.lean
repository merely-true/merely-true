# Borel-Analytic Bridge for Statistical Learning Theory

This file proves that NullMeasurableSet is the exactly right level of measurability
for the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning with Borel-parameterized
concept classes over Polish spaces.

## Main results

- `paramWitnessSet_measurable`: the witness graph {(θ, p) | gap(θ, p) ≥ ε/2} is Borel
- `borel_param_badEvent_analytic`: projection to sample space is analytic (Σ₁¹)
- `analyticSet_nullMeasurableSet`: analytic → NullMeasurableSet (DST bridge lemma)
- `borel_param_wellBehavedVCMeasTarget`: Borel parameterization → WellBehavedVCMeasTarget

## The separation

The counterexample (singleton class over analytic non-Borel A ⊆ ℝ) shows the
bad event can be analytic but NOT Borel, hence WellBehavedVCMeasTarget holds
but KrappWirthWellBehaved fails. See Theorem/BorelAnalyticSeparation.lean.

    Projection of a Borel set from a StandardBorelSpace is analytic (Suslin).
    This is the key step: existential quantification over parameters
    produces an analytic (Σ₁¹) set, which may not be Borel. -/

/-! ## Theorem D: Positive bridge - bad event is NullMeasurableSet -/

/-- Positive bridge. If a concept class is parameterized by a Borel measurable map
`Θ → Concept X` from a standard Borel space `Θ`, then the symmetrization bad event is
analytic, hence `NullMeasurableSet`. The bad event is a Suslin projection of a Borel
witness set (the projection along `Θ` of `{(θ, p) | gap(eval θ, p) ≥ ε / 2}`), and
projections of Borel sets are analytic by definition. This is the entry point through
which Borel parameterization implies the regularity required by the fundamental
theorem. -/

/-! ## Theorem E (F5): Class-level corollary -/

/-- Class-level corollary: every Borel-parameterized concept class with a measurable
evaluation map satisfies `WellBehavedVCMeasTarget`. Composes
`borel_param_nullMeasurableSet_bad_event` over all measurable targets `c`. The
measurable-target variant of `WellBehavedVC` is what the kernel actually proves; the
unrestricted variant remains open and is the subject of the Borel-analytic separation
witness in `Theorem/BorelAnalyticSeparation.lean`. -/

/-- Closure under patching: if `e₁ : Θ₁ → Concept X`, `e₂ : Θ₂ → Concept X`, and a
region selector `r : Ρ → Concept X Bool` are jointly measurable, then so is the
piecewise evaluation
`(θ₁, θ₂, ρ, x) ↦ if r ρ x then e₁ θ₁ x else e₂ θ₂ x`
on the combined parameter space. The basic compositional fact behind
`patch_borel_param_wellBehavedVCMeasTarget`. -/

/-- The patched union of two Borel-parameterized classes (with a measurable region
selector) is itself Borel-parameterized over `Θ₁ × Θ₂ × Ρ`, and therefore satisfies
`WellBehavedVCMeasTarget`. Immediate from `patchEval_measurable` and
`borel_param_wellBehavedVCMeasTarget`. Surfacing this corollary at the class level makes
the closure of the measurable-target hypothesis under amalgamation explicit. -/
