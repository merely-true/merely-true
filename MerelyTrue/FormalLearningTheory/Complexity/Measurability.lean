# Measurability Infrastructure for Learning Theory

This file defines the `MeasurableConceptClass` typeclass, which bundles
the measure-theoretic regularity conditions needed for PAC learning theory.

## Background

The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning (PAC ↔ finite VC dimension)
requires measurability assumptions that are often left implicit in pen-and-paper
proofs. Krapp & Wirth (2024, arXiv:2410.10243) systematically extract these
conditions. This file formalizes them as Lean4 typeclass infrastructure.

The three bundled conditions are:
1. `mem_measurable`: every concept in C is a measurable function
2. `all_measurable`: all concepts X → Bool are measurable (for disagreement sets)
3. `wellBehaved`: the uniform convergence bad event is NullMeasurableSet
   (the `WellBehavedVC` condition from Symmetrization.lean)

Condition 3 is the non-trivial one. For countable concept classes, it holds
automatically. For uncountable classes, the existential quantifier in the UC event
{∃ h ∈ C, |TrueErr - EmpErr| ≥ ε} does not preserve MeasurableSet, and the
NullMeasurableSet weakening is needed. This was discovered during the Lean4
formalization (Session 7) and is a genuine measure-theoretic subtlety absent
from standard textbook presentations.

## Relationship to ad hoc predicates

This typeclass replaces explicit hypothesis threading in theorem signatures:
- `(hmeas_C : ∀ h ∈ C, Measurable h)` → `MeasurableConceptClass.mem_measurable`
- `(hc_meas : ∀ c : Concept X Bool, Measurable c)` → `MeasurableConceptClass.all_measurable`
- `(hWB : WellBehavedVC X C)` → `MeasurableConceptClass.wellBehaved`

Combined with `MeasurableBatchLearner` (Learner/Core.lean), these two typeclasses
provide the complete regularity infrastructure for PAC learning proofs.

universe u

/-- A concept class with the measure-theoretic regularity needed for PAC theory.

    Bundles three conditions:
    1. Every concept in C is measurable
    2. All concepts are measurable (needed for disagreement set measurability)
    3. The UC bad event satisfies NullMeasurableSet (WellBehavedVC)

    Condition 3 is the deep one: for uncountable C, the existential
    {∃ h ∈ C, |TrueErr - EmpErr| ≥ ε} is NOT MeasurableSet in general.
    WellBehavedVC asserts it is NullMeasurableSet, which suffices for
    integration (lintegral_indicator_one₀). -/

/-! ## Bridge API: typeclass → explicit hypotheses

These bridge lemmas allow incremental migration of existing theorems.
Each theorem currently takes explicit `hmeas_C`, `hc_meas`, `hWB` arguments.
With these bridges, callers can write:
  `MeasurableConceptClass.hmeas_C C`
instead of threading the hypothesis manually. -/

/-! ## Instances

TODO: Add automatic instances for common cases:
- Finite concept classes (WellBehavedVC holds automatically)
- Concept classes over MeasurableSingletonClass spaces
- Countable concept classes (existential preserves measurability)
-/

/-! ## UniversallyMeasurableSpace: domain-level measurability

When the domain X is "nice enough" (e.g., MeasurableSingletonClass, countable,
or standard Borel), EVERY concept class over X automatically satisfies
MeasurableConceptClass. This is a property of the space, not the class.

This typeclass captures: "X is regular enough that measurability of learning
events is never an issue." It resolves theorems like `uc_does_not_imply_online`
which quantify over ALL concept classes, not a specific one. -/

/-- A measurable space where all Bool-valued functions are measurable and
    all concept classes are well-behaved (WellBehavedVC).

    This is a domain-level property: it says the σ-algebra on X is rich enough
    that learning-theoretic measurability is automatic.

    Examples:
    - Any MeasurableSingletonClass space (discrete σ-algebra)
    - Any countable space
    - Standard Borel spaces (ℝⁿ with Borel σ-algebra)

    The key consequence: for any C over X, the UC bad event
    {∃ h ∈ C, |TrueErr - EmpErr| ≥ ε} is NullMeasurableSet automatically. -/

/-! ## Krapp-Wirth Measurability Conditions (Definition 3.2)

V-measurability uses the ONE-SIDED ghost gap sup (not absolute value).
This is needed for the implication KrappWirthWellBehaved → WellBehavedVC,
because WellBehavedVC's event is one-sided.

The paper-faithful ABSOLUTE version is KrappWirthVAbs, kept separately. -/

/-! ## Finite-Grid Attainment

EmpiricalError on m samples takes values in {0/m, 1/m, ..., m/m}.
So the one-sided ghost gap takes values in a finite set (differences of grid values).
Therefore sSup is attained, and {sSup ≥ ε} = {∃ h ∈ C, gap(h) ≥ ε}. -/
