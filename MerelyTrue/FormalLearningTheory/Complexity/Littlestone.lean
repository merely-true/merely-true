# Littlestone Dimension (Online Paradigm)

The online-learning analog of VC dimension.
Characterizes mistake-bounded learnability.

/-- A mistake tree (Littlestone tree): a complete binary tree
    where each internal node is labeled with an instance x. -/
inductive MistakeTree (X : Type u) where
  | leaf : MistakeTree X
  | branch : X → MistakeTree X → MistakeTree X → MistakeTree X

/-- Depth of a mistake tree. -/
def MistakeTree.depth {X : Type u} : MistakeTree X → ℕ
  | .leaf => 0
  | .branch _ l r => 1 + max l.depth r.depth

/-- A mistake tree is shattered by C if every root-to-leaf path is
    realized by some concept in C.

    **Note:** This branch-wise definition does NOT restrict the concept class at
    recursive calls. It allows different witness concepts at each tree level without
    requiring path consistency. Counterexample: C = {const_true, const_false} gives
    LittlestoneDim = ⊤ under this definition, but C is online-learnable with M = 1.

    The correct definition (used in `Theorem/Online.lean`) restricts C at each branch:
      | .branch x l r =>
          (∃ c ∈ C, c x = true) ∧ (∃ c ∈ C, c x = false) ∧
          isShattered X {c ∈ C | c x = true} l ∧
          isShattered X {c ∈ C | c x = false} r

    The characterization theorem uses the corrected version. -/
