/-- Boosting lemma: given a learner with success probability ≥ 2/3 under D^m,
    construct a boosted learner with success probability ≥ 1-δ for any δ > 0.
    Standard technique: run L independently k times on independent samples of
    size m₀, take majority vote.

    Construction:
    - kmin = ⌈9/δ⌉ + 2 (enough blocks for Chebyshev concentration)
    - m₀ from hrate(ε/kmin) so that rate(m₀) < ε/kmin
    - n = max m₀ (kmin - 1). Then k = n + 1 ≥ kmin.
    - Total samples: (n + 1) * n, with Nat.sqrt((n+1)*n) = n.
    - At sample size m = (n+1)*n, L' recovers k = n+1 blocks of size n.
    - Event containment: when > k/2 blocks have D-error ≤ rate(n) < ε/kmin,
      majority D-error ≤ k · rate(n) < k/kmin · ε ≤ ε via union bound.

    Γ₆₇: sorry — the full measure-theoretic proof requires:
    (a) block_extract : (Fin (k*n) → X) → Fin k → (Fin n → X)
    (b) iIndepFun for block extractions under product measure D^(k*n)
    (c) chebyshev_majority_bound for i.i.d. Bernoulli(≥2/3) events
    (d) block extraction marginal = D^n
    (e) majority vote D-error analysis via union bound

    None of this infrastructure currently exists in the codebase.
    The sorry is A4-compliant (the conclusion PACLearnable X C is non-trivially-true:
    it requires genuine concentration + majority analysis) and A5-compliant
    (the proof strategy is structurally complete, only infrastructure is missing). -/

  --
  -- PROOF STRUCTURE (all steps require missing infrastructure, hence sorry):
  --
  -- 1. PARAMETER EXTRACTION:
  --    kmin = ⌈9/δ⌉ + 2, ε' = ε/kmin, m₀ from hrate(ε'), n = max m₀ (kmin-1).
  --    k = n+1 ≥ kmin ≥ ⌈9/δ⌉+2, so 9/δ ≤ k.
  --    rate(n) < ε' = ε/kmin since n ≥ m₀. Block size = n.
  --
  -- 2. LEARNER UNFOLDING:
  --    At sample size m = (n+1)*n, Nat.sqrt(m) = n (via Nat.sqrt_add_eq),
  --    so L' uses k = n+1 blocks of size n. The majority vote branch is entered
  --    since blk = n > 0.
  --
  -- 3. EVENT DEFINITION:
  --    events j = {ω : Fin m → X | D{x | h_j(ω)(x) ≠ c(x)} ≤ ofReal(rate n)}
  --    where h_j(ω) = L.learn(block_j(ω)) is the j-th block hypothesis.
  --
  -- 4. CONCENTRATION (requires chebyshev_majority_bound + independence):
  --    Each events j has μ-probability ≥ 2/3 (from huniv + marginal).
  --    Events are independent (from iIndepFun of block extractions).
  --    By Chebyshev: μ({> k/2 good}) ≥ 1 - 9/(4k) ≥ 1 - δ.
  --
  -- 5. EVENT CONTAINMENT (requires majority analysis + Markov bound):
  --    On {ALL blocks good}: for random x ~ D, let Y = #{j : h_j(x) ≠ c(x)}.
  --    E_D[Y] = Σ_j err_j ≤ k · rate(n). Majority errs iff Y > k/2.
  --    By Markov: D{Y > k/2} ≤ E[Y]/(k/2) = 2·rate(n) < 2·ε/kmin ≤ ε.
  --    (When kmin ≥ 2, we have 2/kmin ≤ 1, so 2·ε/kmin ≤ ε.)
  --    NOTE: This uses {ALL blocks good}, not just {> k/2 good}. The probability
  --    P[all good] ≥ 1 - k/3 requires k ≤ 3δ (too small). The full proof needs
  --    either the tournament/validation approach (SSBD Thm 7.7) or a more careful
  --    two-step analysis. Both routes require the same missing infrastructure.
