## Grammar Induction
-/

/-- Grammar induction: learning a formal grammar (regular, CFG) from examples.
    A Gold-style learning process applied to the formal language hierarchy. -/
structure GrammarInduction (Sym : Type*) where
  /-- The class of grammars to learn (regular, CFG, etc.) -/
  grammarClass : Set (FormalLanguage Sym)
  /-- The learning algorithm (Gold-style) -/
  learner : GoldLearner (Word Sym) Bool
  /-- The learner identifies the grammar class in the limit (EX-sense) -/
  -- Full version: EXLearnable (Word Sym) grammarClass
  -- Simplified to Prop for skeleton; would connect to Criterion.lean's EXLearnable
  identifies : Prop

/-- L* algorithm (Angluin 1987): learns DFAs using membership and
    equivalence queries in polynomial time.
    The canonical exact learning algorithm. -/
structure LStar (Sym : Type*) [DecidableEq Sym] [Fintype Sym] where
  /-- The MAT providing queries -/
  teacher : MinimallyAdequateTeacher (Word Sym) Bool
  -- The observation table (implementation detail; the structure tracks the algorithm's state)
  /-- Number of states in the learned DFA -/
  numStates : ℕ
  /-- The learned DFA (after termination) -/
  result : Option (DFA' Sym (Fin (numStates + 1)))

## CEGIS (Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis)
-/

/-- CEGIS: a loop between a synthesizer and a verifier.
    The synthesizer proposes candidates, the verifier checks them and
    returns counterexamples. Terminates when the verifier accepts. -/
structure CEGIS (X : Type u) (Y : Type v) where
  /-- The synthesizer: produces candidate concepts -/
  synth : Synthesizer X Y
  /-- The verifier: checks candidates -/
  verify : Concept X Y → Option X  -- None = correct, Some x = counterexample
  /-- CEGIS loop: iterate synth → verify → refine -/
  loop (counterexamples : List (X × Y)) : Concept X Y :=
    synth counterexamples

## Concept Drift and Non-Stationary Learning
-/

/-- Concept drift: the target concept changes over time.
    Extends the standard (stationary) learning framework.
    The drift model specifies how the target evolves. -/
structure ConceptDrift (X : Type u) (Y : Type v) where
  /-- The concept class (stationary) -/
  conceptClass : ConceptClass X Y
  /-- Time-varying target -/
  target : ℕ → Concept X Y
  /-- All targets are in the class -/
  in_class : ∀ t, target t ∈ conceptClass
  /-- Drift rate: fraction of X on which target changes per step -/
  drift : DriftRate
  /-- Drift is bounded -/
  drift_bounded : 0 ≤ drift

/-- Lifelong learning: learning a sequence of tasks, leveraging
    shared structure across tasks. Meta-learning over time. -/
structure LifelongLearning (X : Type u) (Y : Type v) where
  /-- The sequence of tasks (each task is a concept class) -/
  tasks : ℕ → ConceptClass X Y
  /-- The meta-learner that improves across tasks -/
  metaLearner : MetaLearner X Y
  /-- Performance on task t after seeing tasks 1..t-1 -/
  performance : ℕ → ℝ

/-!
## Inductive Logic Programming
-/

/-- Background knowledge: domain-specific information that guides learning.
    In ILP: a set of known rules/facts that constrain the hypothesis space.
    Analogous to advice. -/
def BackgroundKnowledge (B : Type*) := B

/-- Inductive Logic Programming: learning first-order logic programs
    from examples and background knowledge. -/
structure ILP (X : Type u) (Y : Type v) (B : Type*) where
  /-- Background knowledge -/
  background : BackgroundKnowledge B
  /-- The learner (uses background knowledge) -/
  learner : B → GoldLearner X Y

/-!
## Granger Causality
-/

/-- Granger causality: X Granger-causes Y if past values of X improve
    prediction of Y beyond past values of Y alone.
    Analogy to online learning (sequential, predictive). -/
def GrangerCauses (X Y : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop :=
  -- Prediction error using (past X, past Y) < Prediction error using (past Y only)
  -- For every linear predictor of Y from its own past, there exists a strictly
  -- better predictor that also uses past values of X.
  ∀ (predictY : (ℕ → ℝ) → ℕ → ℝ),
    ∃ (predictXY : (ℕ → ℝ) → (ℕ → ℝ) → ℕ → ℝ),
      ∀ (t : ℕ), |Y t - predictXY X Y t| ≤ |Y t - predictY Y t|

/-!
## Program Synthesis
-/

/-- Program synthesis: learning programs from input-output examples.
    Scope boundary - connects to formal verification. -/
structure ProgramSynthesis (Input Output : Type*) where
  /-- Specification: desired input-output behavior -/
  spec : Input → Output
  /-- Synthesized program -/
  program : Input → Output
  /-- Correctness (partial or total) -/
  correct : ∀ x, program x = spec x

## Scope Boundaries

These concepts mark the BOUNDARY of formal learning theory as covered
in this formalization. They are NOT formally developed; they exist as
markers for potential future extension.
-/

/-- Scope boundary: Multi-armed bandits.
    Related to online learning but with partial feedback (only see reward
    for chosen action, not counterfactual rewards). -/
def ScopeBoundary.Bandits : Prop := True -- marker

/-- Scope boundary: Reinforcement learning.
    Sequential decision-making with state transitions.
    Beyond the concept-learning framework. -/
def ScopeBoundary.RL : Prop := True -- marker

/-- Scope boundary: Quantum learning theory.
    Learning with quantum examples or quantum computation.
    Requires quantum information theory infrastructure. -/
def ScopeBoundary.Quantum : Prop := True -- marker
