# Analytic Sets are NullMeasurableSet

Bridge from analytic sets to null-measurability via Choquet capacity theory.
This file is independent of learning theory and is a candidate for contribution to Mathlib.

open MeasureTheory Set

/-- Inner regularity for analytic sets: every analytic subset of a Polish space can be
approximated from inside by a compact subset, in measure. For any finite Borel measure
`μ`, any analytic `s`, and any `r < μ.real s`, there is a compact `K ⊆ s` with
`μ.real K > r`. The Choquet capacitability theorem (Kechris 30.13), specialised to the
measure-as-capacity instance. -/

/-! ## Main theorem: analytic → NullMeasurableSet -/

/-- **Analytic sets are null-measurable.** For any finite Borel measure on a Polish
space, every analytic set is `NullMeasurableSet`. The proof inner-approximates the
analytic set by compacts via the previous lemma, takes the union of approximators (a
Borel set), and shows the difference is contained in a Borel null set.

This is the abstract result that the entire Borel-analytic measurability layer of the
kernel rests on. The learning-theoretic significance is that the symmetrization bad
event, which is analytic in the Borel-parameterized setting, is automatically
null-measurable; this is enough to run the symmetrization argument under
`NullMeasurableSet` regularity, sidestepping the stronger `MeasurableSet` requirement of
the existing literature. Candidate for upstream contribution to Mathlib. -/
